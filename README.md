# README

This project provides an example terminal user interface built with Javascript/Typescript. It makes use of the [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) and [Enquirer](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer) projects.

## Installation

You'll need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed to run this from your terminal.

To setup the project, first download the source from GitHub. Then open your terminal to the source's root project folder and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Running

Once that's done, you can run the code from the project at any time by running this command:

```
npm start
```

This will execute the code in the `src/index.ts` file.
